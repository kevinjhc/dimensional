# Dimensional

### Overview
- This folder contains the base SCSS files that override the Boostrap defaults and an output CSS file that can be used in production.
- It includes a style and components page as well as a few template pages.

### How to build the CSS file
1. Navigate to the root folder and run `npm run scss`. This command will watch any changes made in '/dimensional-theme' and compile a CSS file.
2. The output file is 'dimensional-light-theme.css' in '/design-system/assets/css'
